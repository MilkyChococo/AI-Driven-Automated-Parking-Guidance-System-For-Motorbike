# AI-Driven-Automated-Parking-Guidance-System-For-Motorbike
**ABSTRACTION**

The large number of university students and their frequent movement in and out of parking areas have created challenges in managing vacant spots for both security personnel and students searching for parking. To address this issue, we propose a Smart Parking System: applying machine learning to guide motorcycles into available spots designated for students.

This approach has both advantages and limitations. With the support of machine learning technology, universities can minimize labor efforts, reduce traffic congestion caused by mismanagement, and prevent overcrowding during peak hours. Students can also save time when searching for parking within the facility.

Our top priority is to design a convenient and simple system that utilizes algorithms to apply to most parking lots within the National University system.
